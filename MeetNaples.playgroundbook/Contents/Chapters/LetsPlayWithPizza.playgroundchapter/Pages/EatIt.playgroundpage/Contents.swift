 # Time to eat!
 
 Well done! You created your favourite pizza in the previous page. Now it's stored in your book data.
 - Note:
 That means that even after coming back to this page in a week you will still find it!
 
 Now look at this drawing, here's Naples with all its beautiness. You can see the famous volcano [Vesuvius](glossary://Vesuvius) together with the [Gulf of Naples](glossary://Gulf) and the rest of the city.
 - - -
 When you're done with looking at the drawing, send the correct message among the ones suggested to see your pizza being put on the windowsill.
 * Callout(And then what?):
 And then... just imagine to be there and eat your pizza!
